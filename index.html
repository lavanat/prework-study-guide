          <li>External CSS style sheet is the most preferable.</li>
          <li>The CSS rule is set up so that you first have the selector for what the style applies to, like h1, ul, etc. then list out the property and values in pairs in the declaration block that follows.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
